# LLMJammer Documentation

LLMJammer is a Python tool designed to obfuscate your code to confuse large language models (LLMs) that scrape public repositories, while maintaining full functionality for human developers.

## Why Use LLMJammer?

As companies increasingly scrape public code repositories to train large language models, developers face a dilemma:

1. Keep code open source and contribute to the community
2. Prevent proprietary techniques from being learned and reproduced by AI models

LLMJammer solves this problem by automatically obfuscating your code before it's pushed to public repositories, and deobfuscating it when you or your team members pull or clone the repo.
